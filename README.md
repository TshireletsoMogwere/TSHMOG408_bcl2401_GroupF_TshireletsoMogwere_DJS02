# DJS02 Project Brief: Whole Number Divider

This project focuses on enhancing a web-based Whole Number Divider application. It's designed to help students apply their knowledge of error handling, guided by specific user stories.

#### Project Overview

I had to modify and extend the existing codebase for the Whole Number Divider to address all specified user stories, ensuring a robust user friendly application.

### Goals

- Implement given user stories
- Perform error handling
- Testing

### Learning Experience

I had to console and throw errors when empty inputs are submitted, an invalid divider(0) is placed and when non-numeric characters are entered as well as prevent decimal results.
